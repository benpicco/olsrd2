   PLUGIN USAGE
==================
REMOTECONTROL plugin by Henning Rogge

The plugin implements three telnet commands to configure and debug the
running agent.

'resource' allows to display the current active memory blocks and timers.
'log' can activate an additional configurable logging sink which will dump
its output into the telnet session.
'config' allows to read and modify the configuration of the agent.

Be careful to restrict the plugin to a limited group of users.



   PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
==========================

The plugin creates a new configuration section called 'remotecontrol', which
has a single parameter 'acl', which limits the addresses that can trigger
the telnet commands.

Example:
--------

[remotecontrol]
    acl          accept_default
