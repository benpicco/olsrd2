   PLUGIN USAGE
==================
ff_etx plugin by Henning Rogge

This plugin calculates a nhdp link metric based on the approved
Freifunk ETX metric.

The metric is directional (it does only consider the outgoing
packet loss), and the ETX value can be between 1 and 16.


   PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
==========================

[ff_ett]
	interval	1.0
	window		64
	start_window	4

"interval" defines the time in seconds after which the ETT-metric is
recalculated. "window" is the number of memory slots (each "interval"
seconds long) that are used to smooth the ETX value.

"start_window" is the number of memory slots that are used at startup.
The number of slots is increased by 1 every interval so that a link can
quickly get up to a reasonable ETX value.
