   PLUGIN USAGE
==================
neighbor_probing plugin by Henning Rogge

This plugin creates unicast traffic to all known neighbors in a roundrobin
scheme. This is necessary to get a reliable linkspeed measurement for
mac80211 links.

The plugin keeps a timestamp for each link when it sent the last probe on
this link. It regularly takes the link which has the oldest timestamp and
checks if there has been unicast traffic on it. If yes, the timestamp is
reset and it continues to look at the other links. If not, the timestamp
is reset too and a probing packet is sent to the links endpoint.
 

   PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
==========================

[neighbor_probing]
	interval	1.0
	size		512
	only_layer2	true

"interval" defines the time in seconds between two probing packets. "size"
is the number of bytes of content of the probe (there is some additional
overhead because the packet is sent as a RFC5444 message).

"only_layer2" can prevent the plugin from sending probing traffic over links
where it cannot get live layer2 data. This prevents probes on ethernet and
other interface without linkdata access.
