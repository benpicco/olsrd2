   PLUGIN USAGE
==================
Hysteresis_olsrv1 plugin by Henning Rogge

This plugin calculates a nhdp link hysteresis similar to the mechanism suggested in OLSRv1.

It use an exponential averaging on incoming (and missing) HELLOs to calculate a link quality between 0 and 1 and
two treshold values to convert the link quality into a binary value.

Its mostly useded as a demonstrator of the hysteresis API of NHDP.


   PLUGIN CONFIGURATION
==========================

[hysteresis_olsrv1]
    accept 0.7
    reject 0.3
    scaling 0.1


The "accept" value defines the treshold at which the link goes up, the "reject" value the treshold when the link goes down.

"Scaling" controls the speed of the exponential aging, lower scaling values mean a slower change of the link quality.

All three parameters must be values between 0 and 1.
