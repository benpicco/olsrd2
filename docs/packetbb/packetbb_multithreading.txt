PacketBB (RFC 5444) handler library
Copyright (c) 2010 Henning Rogge <hrogge@googlemail.com>

The pbb library is a combined parser and generator for RFC 5444
(Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format),
also known as "packetbb".
The library is split into a separate reader and writer part, both
of them use a generic avl-tree and double-linked list implementation.

The reader and writer allow multiple independent code blocks to read
overlapping parts of a PacketBB data stream and assemble packets and
messages together. This allow API users to separate different sub-
protocol in their codebase (e.g. NHDP and OLSRv2).


======================
    Multithreading
======================

The packetbb library contains no static variables, all state is
contained within the pbb_reader and pbb_writer objects (and objects
linked by them). Because of this multiple pbb_reader and pbb_writer
instances can be used by different threads at the same time.

The packetbb library is NOT safe for multithreading in the same
pbb_reader or pbb_writer. Do not call functions of the API with
the same context from different threads at the same time, you
will get strange bugs, segmentation faults or just bad output.
If you have to use the library from more than one thread with
the same context, use a semaphore to prevent concurrent access.

Summary:
NO MULTITHREADING with the same pbb_reader/pbb_writer object.
