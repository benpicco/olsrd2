PacketBB (RFC 5444) handler library
Copyright (c) 2010 Henning Rogge <hrogge@googlemail.com>

The pbb library is a combined parser and generator for RFC 5444
(Generalized Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) Packet/Message Format),
also known as "packetbb".
The library is split into a separate reader and writer part, both
of them use a generic avl-tree and double-linked list implementation.

The reader and writer allow multiple independent code blocks to read
overlapping parts of a PacketBB data stream and assemble packets and
messages together. This allow API users to separate different sub-
protocol in their codebase (e.g. NHDP and OLSRv2).


======================================
    PBB Reader dropcontext feature
======================================

Please read README.reader before you read this file.

If compiled with DISALLOW_CONSUMER_CONTEXT_DROP = 0, the callbacks
may return different values than PBB_OKAY to tell the parser to drop
some packetbb data, which means that later callbacks will not
see parts of the packetbb stream.

Possible return values are:

 * PBB_DROP_PACKET
 * PBB_DROP_MESSAGE
 * PBB_DROP_MSG_BUT_FORWARD
 * PBB_DROP_ADDRESS
 * PBB_DROP_TLV 

PBB_DROP_PACKET is supported by all callbacks and tell the parser
to drop the whole packet. No start_packet, TLV, address or message
will be send to another callback after this.

PBB_DROP_MESSAGE is supported by message and address callbacks and
do the same as PBB_DROP_PACKET, but only for the current message.

PBB_DROP_MSG_BUT_FORWARD is a variant of PBB_DROP_MESSAGE, that
tells the parser to drop the message for other consumers, but still
send it to the message forward callback.

PBB_DROP_ADDRESS can only be used within an address callbacks and
tells the parser to drop the current address.

PBB_DROP_TLV can be used by all block_callbacks and tlv_callbacks
and tells the parser to drop the current TLV.

PBB_DROP_TLV and block_callback together are a special case, because
the block_callback handle multiple TLVs at the same time. If the
callback want to drop one or multiple TLVs, it sets the "drop" boolean
variable in the pbb_tlvblock_consumer_entry array for all TLVs to be
dropped and returns PBB_DROP_TLV. If no "drop" booleans are set,
the return code will be ignored.

The parser guarantees that for each start_callback the corresponding
end_callback will be called, even if the context will be dropped by
any other. If the context was dropped by an earlier callback, the
end_callbacks drop parameter will be true.
