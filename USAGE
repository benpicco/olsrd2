The easiest way to use olsrd2 is to use the built in default settings.
As long as a metric plugin (like ff_etx in the default settings) is compiled
into the executable, the routing agent can be used without any configuration
beyond the mesh interfaces.

To activate olsrd2 and set wlan0 as a single mesh interface, start the routing
agent from a shell like this:

> olsrd2 --set interface[wlan0].

The alternative is to setup a configuration file instead:

[interface=wlan0]



You can save the configuration file in the default position 
(/etc/olsrd2/olsrd2.conf), olsrd2 will automatically load it.

> olsrd2

Another option is to explicitly state the configuration file.

> olsrd2 --load /etc/olsrd2/olsrd2.conf



You can get the full set of configuration options with the following command:

> olsrd2 --help
